<p>My first two-day hackathon I created an real-time multiplayer game called QuizTime.  Users go to the site (<a href="http://qu.izti.me" title="Quiz Time" target="_blank">http://qu.izti.me</a>) and list items that relate to a set category.  Guesses can only be picked once, so you have to be quick.  The user with the most correct answers wins the round.</p>

<p>This was not my first time making a socket.io game.  I made the back end in Node.js and used Socket.io to handle the websockets. Ben Davis, who I met the first morning, created the front end using Twitter Bootstrap and CSS know-how.</p>
<p>And to keep things interesting, I created an Android app using PhoneGap that worked pretty well on tablets.</p>
<p>I got my fair share of swag and delicious food.  In the end, some more thought out and useful hacks won.  I'm excited to see where <a href="https://twitter.com/mytrubalance" target="_blank">truBalance</a> goes with their idea, it's very promising.</p>
