<p>Using PHP and Knockout.js, I created a resident portal for Kingsley Management from the ground up. There are currently over 600 active users over 40 different parks. The system also handles all Online ACH Payments, both one-time and monthly recurring batch payments.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>View Ledger information</li>
<li>Update Personal Information</li>
<li>Make Online Payments</li>
<li>Contact Park Management</li>
<li>View information about upcoming payments due</li>
<li>Opt in to receive electronic statements</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also prepared a <a title="Resident Portal Mockup" href="http://dev.bold-it.com/residentportal/Main.php" target="_blank">mock version</a> to show off. For username/password, enter anything.<br />
In the mock version, changes will not go through and you won't be able to actually make payments.</p>
