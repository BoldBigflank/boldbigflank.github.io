<p>I created a Cocos2d-iphone game for the iPhone/Sphero in 36 hours.</p>
<p>When I got a Sphero from the <a href="http://www.bold-it.com/?p=204" target="_blank">Seattle Startup Weekend</a> in May, I brainstormed what this thing could do.  I thought of a cool behavior for a Sphero, where it changes its color as it moves based on a picture of your choosing.  Friday, it clicked: turn it into a picture guessing game similar to Pictionary.  The deadline was midnight Sunday, so I had to act quick.  I bought my snacks and settled into a 36-hour marathon programming session.</p>
<p>Long story short, I did it.  I wasn't so sure near the end, but everything clicked and I even had time to prepare my <a href="http://www.bold-it.com/?p=269" target="_blank">other project</a> for the competition.</p>
