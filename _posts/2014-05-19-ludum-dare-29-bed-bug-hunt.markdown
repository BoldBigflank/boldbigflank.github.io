<p>Using Unity3d, I created a simple game to fit the theme "Beneath the Surface".  It was an experiment involving moving individual vertexes of a mesh.</p>
<p>This was made as <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=35325">my entry</a> into Ludum Dare 29.  The game is very simple, objects below the stripes are moving around and your task is to poke them.  I created this by attaching rigidbodies and spring joints to every vertex of the stripe object.</p>
