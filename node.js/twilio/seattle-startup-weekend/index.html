    <p>I used <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.JS</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> to create the back end for Seattle Startup Weekend group <a href="http://www.tablesurfing.org" target="_blank">TableSurfing.org</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/medialibrary/458191_10100312138778413_23200732_43543274_326208815_o.jpeg" title="at seattle startup weekend" class="alignnone" width="600" /></p>
<p>On Friday night, Sheikh Shuvo presented the idea of building a tool that allows people to meet local chefs in their area as well as show off their own cooking skills.  The idea got a lot of support, and a ten person team formed out of it.  We ended up with three developers, two graphic designers, four business/marketing people and Sheikh.  We were warned of some of the issues with a big team having to do with the limited time of the event, but I didn't notice any of those issues arising in my work.  We all had a pretty tight focus on what was important and got done everything we could.</p>
<p>Saturday was a beast.  I got a development system going both on my own system and an EC2 Instance, then dove in.  I set up MongoDB and made some models to manipulate via <a href="https://www.learnboost.com/blog/mongoose/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>.  I set up Express and made the routes for all the actions that will be happening (user profiles creation/viewing, event creation/viewing/searching).  My codevelopers Ash and <a href="http://twitter.com/umeshunni" target="_blank">Umesh</a> made some Jade templates and CSS styles to match our designers' mockups on the front end.  After we were kicked out at midnight, I plugged away at the <a href="http://everyauth.com/" target="_blank">Everyauth</a> plugin to implement Facebook connectivity.</p>
<p>Two hours of sleep later, I was back in on Sunday, fixing bugs and putting out fires and making a solid demo.  Our marketing side was doing all sorts of things, from emailing professional chefs to hitting the streets asking others about the idea.</p>
<p>Here is our presentation from Sunday night (thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/SteveSeow" target="_blank">Steve Seow</a> for recording). My cameo is about two and a half minutes in:<br />
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AxMTpOWQQ7c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's got a long way to be useful, from both a development and a marketing perspective, but I'm excited to carry this forward to a working product.  I spent Sunday night exhausted but unable to sleep due to the amount of awesome I had just experienced.</p>
<p>The hardest part of the event was getting all the bugs out to have a working demo by the end of Sunday.  I still prefer that to street contacting, which our business team did great at.</p>
<p>What brought me the most joy was the simplicity of adding Twilio to the project.  I had made a little snippet that sent a text message through the Twilio REST API earlier, and dropping it in brought almost instant results.  For the tech-types, here's the code:</p>
<p>[javascript title="twilio.js"]<br />
var https = require('https');</p>
<p>var accountSid = &quot;AC********************************&quot;;<br />
var authToken = &quot;********************************&quot;;<br />
var API_SERVER = 'api.twilio.com';<br />
var API_VERSION = '2010-04-01';<br />
var from = &quot;+18889990000&quot;; // Twilio Verified number</p>
<p>exports.sendText = function(to, body, cb){<br />
    var postData = &quot;To=&quot; + to + &quot;&amp;From=&quot; + from + &quot;&amp;Body=&quot; + body;<br />
	var options = {<br />
        host: API_SERVER,<br />
        port: 443,<br />
        path: '/' + API_VERSION +&quot;/Accounts/&quot; + accountSid + &quot;/SMS/Messages&quot;,<br />
        method: 'POST',<br />
        auth: accountSid + ':' + authToken,<br />
        headers: {&quot;Content-Type&quot;:&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;,<br />
					&quot;Content-Length&quot;:postData.length}<br />
	};</p>
<p>	var req = https.request(options, function(res) {</p>
<p>        res.on('data', function(d) {<br />
            return cb(null, d);<br />
        });<br />
	});</p>
<p>	req.write(postData); // Write the body<br />
	req.end();</p>
<p>	req.on('error', function(e) {<br />
        console.error(e);<br />
        return cb(e, null);<br />
	});</p>
<p>};<br />
[/javascript]</p>
<p>I think there's a node.js helper library out now, so I would recommend that if you want all the features.</p>
